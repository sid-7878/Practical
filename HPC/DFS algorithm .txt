DFS algorithm 

CODE:-
def dfs(graph, start, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    visited.add(start)
    print(start, end=' ')
    for next in graph[start]:
        if next not in visited:
            dfs(graph, next, visited)
    return visited
graph = {0: [1, 2], 1: [2], 2: [3], 3: [1, 2]}
dfs(graph, 0)
