BFS algorithm 

CODE:-
from collections import deque
def bfs(graph, start):
    visited, queue = set(), deque([start])
    while queue:
        vertex = queue.popleft()
        if vertex not in visited:
            visited.add(vertex)
            queue.extend(set(graph[vertex]) - visited)
    return visited
graph = {0: [1, 2], 1: [2], 2: [3], 3: [1, 2]}
print("BFS starting from vertex 2:", bfs(graph, 2))
